/*
 * Revision history:
 *
 *  Version 1.3beta4 (2001-12-01)
 *
 *      probe() and capture() now use a new proberecord structure which
 *      contains information about each probe in a modularized way.
 *
 *      Added a new command line argument, --track-port, which causes each
 *      probe to have a unique source port so that something other than the
 *      IP ID can be used to track it, and also a corresponding --track-id
 *      argument to specify the old behavior of tracking IP ID's.  If a
 *      source port is specified with -p, --track-id is implied.  The
 *      compile-time default on Solaris is --track-port, enabling
 *      tcptraceroute to work out-of-the-box, and --track-id on all other
 *      platforms.
 *
 *      probe() now calls allocateid() to generate an IP ID, which
 *      caches the last ALLOCATEID_CACHE_SIZE allocations to prevent
 *      against duplicates.
 *
 *      Display "!<N>" instead of "!?" for unknown ICMP codes, as
 *      suggested by Kevin McAllister <kevin@mcallister.net>
 *
 *      Attempts to find virtual addresses under OpenBSD, based on a
 *      patch by Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>
 *
 *      Moves the datalinkoffset and datalinkname information into a
 *      single data structure, which is much more logical, and less
 *      prone to error.
 *
 *      Improved command line argument handling a good deal, based on
 *      suggestions by Scott Fenton <scott@matts-books.com>.  "-q 3",
 *      "-q3", "-qw 3 1", and "-q3w1" are all perfectly legal, now.
 *
 *      It is now possible to traceroute to yourself, by switching the
 *      device to the loopback interface if the destination matches the
 *      address of a local interface.  Additionally, as learned by
 *      looking through the nmap source, we now never set a libpcap
 *      filter on the loopback interface to avoid apparent libpcap bugs
 *      which previously made it impossible to traceroute to 127.0.0.1
 *
 *      Added -S and -A command line arguments to control the the SYN
 *      and ACK flags in outgoing packets.  By using -A, it is now
 *      possible to traceroute through stateless firewalls which
 *      permit hosts behind the firewalls to establish outgoing TCP
 *      connections.  In the absence of either -A or -S, -S is set.
 *
 *      Added -N command line argument which takes the place of the
 *      previous RESOLVE_RFC1918 #define.
 *
 *      Now displays if the remote host is ECN capable when using -E
 *
 *  Version 1.2 (2001-07-31)
 *
 *      Contains large portions of code and ideas contributed by
 *      Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>
 *
 *      Attempt to determine what outgoing interface to use based on
 *      the destination address and the local system's interface list.
 *      Could still use a good deal of work on BSD systems, though,
 *      especially when it comes to virtual addresses which reside on
 *      subnets different than the primary address.
 *      
 *      The timeout code has been reworked significantly, and should
 *      now be much more reliable.
 *      
 *      Added -E command line argument to send ECN (RFC2481) packets.
 *      Requested by Christophe Barb <christophe.barbe@lineo.fr> and
 *      Jim Penny <jpenny@debian.org>
 *
 *      Added -l command line argument to set the total packet length,
 *      including IP header.
 *      
 *      Added support for sending more than one probe to each hop, and
 *      the -q command line option to specify the number of probes.
 *      
 *      Added -F command line argument to set the IP_DF bit.
 *      
 *      Added -t command line argument to set the IP TOS.
 *      
 *      Now properly checks the length of the packets returned by libpcap
 *      before blindly assuming that the entire header structure we happen
 *      to be looking for is there.  This could have been very ugly had the
 *      snaplen not been set so conservatively.
 *      
 *      Print banner information to stderr, not stdout, to be compatible with
 *      traceroute(8).  Reported by Scott Fenton <scott@matts-books.com>
 *
 *      Fixed an endian bug reported by Zoran Dzelajlija <jelly@srk.fer.hr>,
 *      which prevented users from specifying the destination port number by
 *      name.
 *
 *  Version 1.1 (2001-06-30)
 *
 *      Now drops root privileges after sockets have been opened.
 *
 *      Must now be root to use -s or -p, making it now safe to to install
 *      tcptraceroute suid root, without fear that users can generate arbitrary
 *      SYN packets.
 *
 *  Version 1.0 (2001-04-10)
 *
 *      Initial Release.
