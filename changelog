/*
 * Revision history:
 *
 *  Version 1.2 (2001-07-31)
 *
 *      Contains large portions of code and ideas contributed by
 *      Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>
 *      
 *      Attempt to determine what outgoing interface to use based on the
 *      destination address and the local system's interface list.  Could
 *      still use a good deal of work on BSD systems, though, especially
 *      when it comes to virtual addresses which reside on subnets
 *      different than the primary address.
 *      
 *      The timeout code has been reworked significantly, and should now
 *      be much more reliable.
 *      
 *      Added -E command line argument to send ECN (RFC2481) packets.
 *      Requested by Christophe Barb <christophe.barbe@lineo.fr> and
 *      Jim Penny <jpenny@debian.org>
 *      
 *      Added -l command line argument to set the total packet length,
 *      including IP header.
 *      
 *      Added support for sending more than one probe to each hop, and
 *      the -q command line option to specify the number of probes.
 *      
 *      Added -F command line argument to set the IP_DF bit.
 *      
 *      Added -t command line argument to set the IP TOS.
 *      
 *      Now properly checks the length of the packets returned by libpcap
 *      before blindly assuming that the entire header structure we happen
 *      to be looking for is there.  This could have been very ugly had the
 *      snaplen not been set so conservatively.
 *      
 *      Print banner information to stderr, not stdout, to be compatible
 *      with traceroute(8).  Reported by Scott Fenton <scott@matts-books.com>
 *
 *      Fixed an endian bug reported by Zoran Dzelajlija <jelly@srk.fer.hr>,
 *      which prevented users from specifying the destination port number by
 *      name.
 *
 *  Version 1.1 (2001-06-30)
 *
 *      Now drops root privileges after sockets have been opened.
 *
 *      Must now be root to use -s or -p, making it now safe to to
 *      install tcptraceroute suid root, without fear that users can
 *      generate arbitrary SYN packets.
 *
 *  Version 1.0 (2001-04-10)
 *
 *      Initial Release
