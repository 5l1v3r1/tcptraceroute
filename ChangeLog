Version 1.5beta2 (2003-05-25)

    Added an autoconf check to detect MacOS X systems by looking to
    see if __APPLE__ and __MACH__ are defined.  Also added an autoconf
    configure command line argument --enable-noselect-default to control
    the default behavior of the tcptraceroute --noselect command line
    argument, and enabled it by default on MacOS X systems if not
    otherwise specified.

Version 1.5beta1 (2003-05-24)

    Most substantially, support for both autoconf and libnet-1.1.x
    has been added, based on patches from (in alphabetical order):

        jbash@velvet.com
        Jon Allen Boone <ipmonger@delamancha.org>
        James Ralston <qralston@andrew.cmu.edu>
        Darren Tucker <dtucker@zip.com.au>
        Matt Weidner <mattweidner@webmail.co.za>
    
    Added linklayer support for PPPoE interfaces, by Darren Tucker
    <dtucker@zip.com.au>.

    Improved the round trip time calculations, by Amgad Zeitoun
    <azeitoun@eecs.umich.edu>.

    Removed a number of multi-line strings, which apparently causes
    trouble for some compilers, based on patches from:

        Richard van den Berg <richard@vdberg.org>
        Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>

Version 1.4 (2002-07-30)

    Added linklayer support for Linux ISDN Sync-PPP interfaces,
    by Dr. Peter Bieringer <pbieringer@aerasec.de>.

    Adds support back for DLT_RAW interfaces, which was inadvertently
    removed sometime between 1.2 and 1.3beta1, and as a result caused
    tcptraceroute to fail over PPP interfaces.  Reported in Debian
    Bug#154793 by David Harris <eelf@sympatico.ca>.

Version 1.3 (2002-05-19)

    Now detects (and ignores) IP packets with IP options.

    Packets are now properly aligned by allocating new space and
    copying the packet data there before casting packet header
    structs against them.

    New, undocumented --no-select command line argument added to never
    call select(), which fails to indicate that a BPF socket is ready
    for reading on some BSD systems.

    Now sets a non-zero exit code if the destination was not reached,
    as suggested by Arndt Schoenewald <arndt@schoenewald.de>

    Fixes an off-by-one error in getinterfaces(), discovered by
    Kit Knox <kit@rootshell.com>.

    probe() and capture() now use a new proberecord structure which
    contains information about each probe in a modularized way.

    Added a new command line argument, --track-port, which causes each
    probe to have a unique source port so that something other than the
    IP ID can be used to track it, and also a corresponding --track-id
    argument to specify the old behavior of tracking IP ID's.  If a
    source port is specified with -p, --track-id is implied.  The
    compile-time default on Solaris is --track-port, enabling
    tcptraceroute to work out-of-the-box, and --track-id on all other
    platforms.

    probe() now calls allocateid() to generate an IP ID, which
    caches the last ALLOCATEID_CACHE_SIZE allocations to prevent
    against duplicates.

    Display "!<N>" instead of "!?" for unknown ICMP codes, as
    suggested by Kevin McAllister <kevin@mcallister.net>

    Attempts to find virtual addresses under OpenBSD, based on a
    patch by Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>

    Moves the datalinkoffset and datalinkname information into a
    single data structure, which is much more logical, and less
    prone to error.

    Improved command line argument handling a good deal, based
    on suggestions by Scott Fenton <scott@matts-books.com>.  First,
    a pass through is made to process and shift out long command
    line arguments, then the remaining command line is passed to
    getopt().

    It is now possible to traceroute to yourself, by switching the
    device to the loopback interface if the destination matches the
    address of a local interface.  Additionally, as learned by
    looking through the nmap source, we now never set a libpcap
    filter on the loopback interface to avoid apparent libpcap bugs
    which previously made it impossible to traceroute to 127.0.0.1

    Added -S and -A command line arguments to control the SYN
    and ACK flags in outgoing packets.  By using -A, it is now
    possible to traceroute through stateless firewalls which
    permit hosts behind the firewalls to establish outgoing TCP
    connections.  In the absence of either -A or -S, -S is set.

    Added -N command line argument which takes the place of the
    previous RESOLVE_RFC1918 #define.

    Now displays if the remote host is ECN capable when using -E

Version 1.2 (2001-07-31)

    Contains large portions of code and ideas contributed by
    Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>

    Attempt to determine what outgoing interface to use based on
    the destination address and the local system's interface list.
    Could still use a good deal of work on BSD systems, though,
    especially when it comes to virtual addresses which reside on
    subnets different than the primary address.
    
    The timeout code has been reworked significantly, and should
    now be much more reliable.
    
    Added -E command line argument to send ECN (RFC2481) packets.
    Requested by Christophe Barb <christophe.barbe@lineo.fr> and
    Jim Penny <jpenny@debian.org>

    Added -l command line argument to set the total packet length,
    including IP header.
    
    Added support for sending more than one probe to each hop, and
    the -q command line option to specify the number of probes.
    
    Added -F command line argument to set the IP_DF bit.
    
    Added -t command line argument to set the IP TOS.
    
    Now properly checks the length of the packets returned by libpcap
    before blindly assuming that the entire header structure we happen
    to be looking for is there.  This could have been very ugly had the
    snaplen not been set so conservatively.
    
    Print banner information to stderr, not stdout, to be compatible with
    traceroute(8).  Reported by Scott Fenton <scott@matts-books.com>

    Fixed an endian bug reported by Zoran Dzelajlija <jelly@srk.fer.hr>,
    which prevented users from specifying the destination port number by
    name.

Version 1.1 (2001-06-30)

    Now drops root privileges after sockets have been opened.

    Must now be root to use -s or -p, making it now safe to to install
    tcptraceroute suid root, without fear that users can generate arbitrary
    SYN packets.

Version 1.0 (2001-04-10)

    Initial Release.
